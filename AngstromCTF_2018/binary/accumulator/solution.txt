This was a integer overflow problem. In C, since integers are represented in their 2's complement representation, giving a large enough number will make the value to be wrapped around in a way that its binary 2's complement representation comes to be negative.
Therefore when we give a large enough integer value like '23564567658' 2 times, it will go out of range and make accumulator's value to be negative.
